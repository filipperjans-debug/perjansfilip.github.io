            <div class="modal-text">Every year on May 29, Sweden honors its veterans and their families through a formal state ceremony organized by the Swedish Armed Forces. It's one of their biggest events of the year and at BANG I have produced this twice. Our role was the overall production responsibility, ensuring a seamless and dignified experience for both on-site visitors and a national digital audience.<br><br>
                My role covered the entire production chain, from initial strategic planning to the final on-site execution. This included the management of large-scale infrastructure such as tents, grandstands, fencing, and complex electrical setups, as well as essential operational services like medical preparedness, security, and sanitation.<br><br>
                The result was a successfully executed production delivered strictly according to plan, warmly received by the around 4,500 employees of the Swedish Armed Forces, visitors and veterans.

            <div class="modal-text">
                To launch the new Predator football boots, adidas Football Nordic and Unisport didn’t just want attention — they wanted impact. So they called in BANG to turn hype into experience.<br><br>
                We took over a padel court in Nørrebro — a district known for diversity, street culture and creative energy. The perfect match for the Predator mindset. There, we built the Predator Cage: 45 seconds, one high-tech goal, and as many goals as you could score. Top scorer of the day? Immortalized on a mural wall in central Copenhagen. Top 5? Custom boots. No pressure.<br><br>
                To crank up the energy even more, we brought in heavy-hitting creators like Jasseminho, Anusha, Sarah and Drux who turned the space into a live arena with panna, freestyles, and crowd battles.<br><br>
                The response was massive — over 5,000 visitors and 286 players in the Predator Cage. 198 of them came back for a second shot, and 146 couldn’t stop at two. Online, we hit 190,000+ views, led by reels and TikToks. Goals, glory and faces on walls. This was more than a launch. It was football, culture and competition. All in one strike.

            <div class="modal-text">Rekoroben. An exclusive second-hand store in Karlstad, aimed to increase its brand awareness and reach a wider customer base. With a limited presence in the market, they needed strategies to convey their unique offering and sustainable message to a larger audience.<br><br>
            We developed a concise and comprehensive document, outlining tailored marketing strategies, audience insights and media tactics. This informed Rekoroben on effective methods to elevate their presence and engage in their target market.<br><br>
            Then, we created an captivating slogan "Reuse like there's a tomorrow", reflecting Rekoroben´s commitment to sustainability and playing with humor and expressions. Designed in their signature font and colors, produced to adorn tote bags, blending aesthetics with eco-awareness, serving as mobile billboards for the brand.<br><br>
            What do you get if you mix champagne and a quiz about sustainability? A very nice eveneing and a perfect way for Rekoroben to promoting their ethos. So that's what we planned. An engaging event centered around sustainability. A good way for Rekoroben to find new customers, as well as retain their current ones.

            <div class="modal-text">The Swedish Armed Forces has a significant recruitment need in IT. This is an industry and market where competition for talent is fierce. <br><br> 
                An important part of the recruitment effort is therefore career fairs and events, where the first meeting with potential candidates is crucial. The challenge lies in quickly arousing curiosity, creating relevance, and initiating a dialogue—in an environment where the target group has many options and high expectations. <br><br>
So, we gamified the challenge and created Försvara Nätet, a web-based IT game that drops players into three simultaneous missions with a ticking clock. Prioritize, analyze, decide—just like in real IT operations. Easy mechanics and simple design to lower the threshold, while making the challenges more difficult.<br><br>
Engagement was high. Players were hooked, conversations flowed, and curiosity turned into connection. Candidates left impressed, challenged, and inspired.

                From initial concept to on-site execution, BANG managed the entire production of House of Desperados. The activation featured a massive party tent equipped with lounge areas and interactive installations. To drive engagement, guests could participate in activities like "Mega Pong" or the "Wheel of Desperados" for a chance to win exclusive merchandise. The result was a high-traffic destination where the energy remained high throughout the events.

From drafting initial invitations to analyzing attendance statistics and conducting post-event surveys.<br><br>
                I have delivered these digital solutions for organizations and brands such as the Swedish Armed Forces, Michelin, Eskilstuna Municipality and Ardbeg Embassy to name a few.

            <div class="modal-text">2024 might just be the year when creativity meets artificial intelligence and is transforming the advertising industry. But won't AI replace human jobs, some might think? Not as long as you know how to use it, says Max Rosell, our Art Director at BANG Agency.<br><br>
It's all about keeping up with and taking advantage of the technology. Just like when Photoshop popped up, suddenly you could turn a blue car red in a minute. AI can revolutionize the way we create ads. Over the past year, platforms like Midjourney have become invaluable tools for me as a creative professional. The platform has allowed me to immerse myself in the world of AI-generated images. <br><br>
Sure, they often have a specific "AI feel" to them, but that inspired me to experiment. I skipped sharpness and colour and embraced blurriness, ambiguity, and graininess. Suddenly, I discovered a whole new kind of beauty in the images. And it didn't stop there – with Runway Gen-2, I created AI-generated videos in no time. Now, with Open AI’s newest addition Sora, I’m itching to dive in and explore even more. Quick drafts, storyboards and animatics? Check!<br><br>
I can now easily and quickly create drafts for my clients, which allows me to focus more on creative ideas. AI has allowed me to increase my efficiency and realize my artistic visions, Max continues.<br><br>
At BANG Agency, we're all in on the AI revolution. We strive to be part of the race by understanding and seizing every opportunity it presents. As we gear up for another year of groundbreaking work in AI, we're fueled by the prospect of unlocking even greater creative potential. AI may still not be able to generate innovative concepts for our clients. Still, it paves the way for creative professionals to dive deeper into what we love most – being creative and cooking up ideas like never before. Here's to another year of pushing the boundaries and reshaping the future of advertising with AI.
